    <h1>Ben Goldhaber</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">Hi - I'm Ben Goldhaber, owner of the much coveted bengoldhaber.com domain.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Some relevant facts about me:</strong></p>
    
    <p>I work at <a href="https://www.flf.org/" target="_blank">FLF</a> incubating and supporting teams to scale differentially beneficial technology. I think if we can harness advances in AI to improve civilizational reasoning, coordination, and security, we can collectively steer away from catastrophe and towards an amazing future.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://bengoldhaber.substack.com/" target="_blank">I write a monthly links list / personal journal / navel gazing exercise</a>. It's a pretty good way to get a sense of the type of stuff I think about and what I like to read.</p>

    <p>Here are a few areas (by no means exhaustive) which I think are particularly important:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="provably-secure-software.html">Use AI to Write Provably Secure Software</a></li>
        <li><a href="ai-forecasting-sensemaking.html">Accelerate AI for Forecasting and Sensemaking</a></li>
        <li>Implement High Assurance Safety Practices in Frontier AI companies</li>
        <li><a href="creating-positive-visions.html">Creating Positive Visions for the Future</a></li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>Some of my hobbies include meditation, weightlifting, going to saunas, and spending too much time on <a href="https://x.com/BenGoldhaber" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>
